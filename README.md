## Project History
UBsync was originally forked from [ownCloud-sync](https://launchpad.net/owncloud-sync), a dedicated Nextcloud application for **Ubuntu touch 16.04**,  supported by [Ubports](https://www.ubports.com).

This repository continues, where [UBsync Launchpad Project](https://code.launchpad.net/~ocs-team/owncloud-sync/UBsync) finished.

This fork was originally created as a reaction to the discussion at [forums.ubports.com](https://forums.ubports.com/topic/5116/help-creating-an-ubsync-arm64-version/30) related to missing amr64 support for UBsync.

Later the development was returned to Launchpad for a short period but after discussions in the developers/testers community - since version 0.7, 
the development was moved to GitHub because GitHub remains one of two major platforms, 
where UBports community lives and Github-centric development is more comfortable for current maintainers.

Code evolution is documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
